  @item{
    Extra keys are now detected during config updates and rejected if present.
    This should catch common user errors (e.g. forgetting to nest resource
    config under \code{source}) and backwards-incompatible changes more safely
    (e.g. renaming \code{trigger} to something else).
  }

  @item{
    You can now use the GitHub release resource without an access token for
    everything except publishing a resource.
  }

  @item{
    The GitHub Release resource now \italic{actually} supports being used as an
    input. We had previously forgotten to actually wire in the command. Woops.
